Read file with InputStream and FileReader

- Reader implementations are used to read character array (text) from a source
- Writer implementations are used to write character array (text) to a target.
- They both work on streams and provide special methods for character processing.

READER IMPLEMENTATIONS
- Reader automatically converts raw bytes to proper unicode (UTF8-UTF-16) and helps the developer.
  Reader impementations are:
  	- InputStreamReader
  	- CharArrayReader
  	- FileReader
  	
READER
- Reader instance reads character from a stream one by one.
- Works around a stream. So you need to use an InputStream and Reader together.

int				read()								Reads a single character.
int				read(char[]cbuf )					Reads characters into an array.
abstract int	read(char[]cbuf,int off,int len)	Reads characters into an array.
