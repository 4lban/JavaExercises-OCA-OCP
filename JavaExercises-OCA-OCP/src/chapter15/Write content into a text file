USING FILEWRITER

FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(new File("C:\\test2\\sonuc.txt"));
writer.append(builder.toString());
writer.flush();

FLUSHING THE STREAM
- Flush method complete the actual writing to the disk
- If you don't flush the stream, all the data is stored in the stream and can not be written to the disk.
- Don't forget flushing after writing to the stream.
