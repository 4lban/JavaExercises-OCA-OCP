Object class

Object is super class for all Java classes
Any class without explicit extends clause is a direct subclass of Object.
Because all of the object instances have some common features:
- Logical comparison to other instances with same type: equals() method
- Summarizing the data inside as a string: toString() method
- Summarizing the data inside accordin to a customized hashCode() method


Method toString()
- Returns String representation of object: describes state of object
- Automatically called when:
	- Object is concatenated with a String
	- Object is printed using print() or println()
	- Object reference is passed to assert statement

Example

	Rectangle r = new Rectangle(0, 0, 20, 40);
	System.out.println(r);
	
More on toString()
- Default toString() method just prints (full) class name & hash code of object
- Not all API classes override toString()
- Good idea to implement for debugging purposes:
	- Should return String containing values of important fields along with their
	  names
	- Should also return result of getClass().getName() rather than hard coded class name
