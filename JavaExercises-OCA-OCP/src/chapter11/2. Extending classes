HOW TO INHERIT

- Inheriting the behaviours of another class is made by extending this class.

- class Vehicle()
- class Plane extends Vehicle{}


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU EXTEND A CLASS ?
When you extend a class these properties are absorbed by the derived class:
- protected fields
- public and default fields
- protected methods
- public and default methods


DERIVED CLASS
- Derived class is a specialized, more specific version of a super class.
  That's why, we define wheelCount of Vehicle class as 4 in Car class.
- Derived class has protected/default/public attributes and methods of super
  class
- Derived class may set values for inherited values and add more attributes.
- Derived class may change the behaviour of methods.
