Unchecked Exceptions
- An Unchecked exception does not require explicit handling, though it could be 
  processed	that way
- The only unchecked exceptions in Java are objects of type RuntimeExceptions
  or its descendants
- Similar to RuntimeException and its descendants could not be caught

Checked Exceptions
- An Exception is either checked or unchecked
- A Checked exception either must be caught by a method, or must be listed in the
  throws clause of any method that may throw or propagate it
- A throws clause is appended to the method header
- The compiler will issue an error if a checked exception is not handled
