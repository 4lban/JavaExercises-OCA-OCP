MOST USED INTERFACES

Some common interfaces shipped with JDK

- Comparable: Compare magnitude of object instances
- Clonable: Create a copy of object instances
- Serializable: Converting object instances to byte streams


COMPARABLE 
- Make any class comparable in magnitude.
- Used implicitly when you order a collection of instances by built-in classes such as
  Collections.sort or Arrays.sort
- The algorithm you defined in compareTo method will be the natural ordering of this class.
  example order array of object by size

class AnyClass implements Comparable {
	int compareTo(Object o){
	
	}
}

COMPARETO METHOD
method call						fact								result
instance2.compareTo(instance1)	instance2 is greater than d1		1
instance2.compareTo(instance1)	instance2 and instance1 are same	0
instance2.compareTo(instance1)	instance2 is smaller than instance1	-1
