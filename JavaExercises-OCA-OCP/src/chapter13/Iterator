The Iterator interface
- An iterator is an object that will return the elements of a collection, one at a time
- interface Iterator<E>
	- boolean hasNext()
		- Returns true if the iteration has more elements
	- E next()
		- Returns the next element in the iteration
	- void remove()
		- Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by the iterator (optional operation)
		
		
The ListIterator interface
- An iterator is an object that will return the elements of a collection, one at a time
- interface ListIterator<E>
	- boolean hasNext()
		- Returns true if the iteration has more elements
	- E next()
		- Returns the next element in the iteration
	- boolean hasPrevious()
		- Returns true if the iteration has previous elements
	- E previous()
		-Returns the previous element in the iteration
	- void remove()
		- Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by the iterator (optional operation)
