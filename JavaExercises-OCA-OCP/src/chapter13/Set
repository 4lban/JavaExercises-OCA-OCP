The Set interface

- A set is a collection like Map. The difference is sets:
	- Do not allow duplicate items. If any object exists 
	  with same hashCode() result and equality with 
	  equals() method, the new object is not put.
	- Don't use explicit key. hashCode() of each
	  instance is the key itself.
	  
Set is used for DUPLICATE ITEM REMOVAL
