ENUMERATION

WHAT IS ENUM?
- Enum is a special class for limiting the possible values for a field.
- You list all possible values that a field can be assigned 

ENUM EXAMPLE
- For instance our Person class has gender and licensed fields.
- Gender may be MALE, FEMALE or OTHER
- Licensed fields have two possible values: LICENSED and UNLICENSED.

	public enum Gender {  
		MALE,
		FEMALE,
		OTHER
	}

USAGE OF ENUM
- When you call Gender.MALE you get an Gender instance.
- You can not set anything else to a Gender attribute. This is what enum for.
