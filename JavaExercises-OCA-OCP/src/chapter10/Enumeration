ENUMERATION

- What is enum?
Enum is a special class for limiting the possible values for a field.
You list all possible values that a field can be assigned 

- Enum example
For instance our Person class has gender and licensed fields.
Gender may be MALE, FEMALE or OTHER
Licensed fields have two possible values: LICENSED and UNLICENSED.

public enum Gender {  
	MALE,
	FEMALE,
	OTHER
}

- Usage of enum
When you call Gender.MALE you get an Gender instance.
You can not set anything else to a Gender attribute. This is what enum for.
