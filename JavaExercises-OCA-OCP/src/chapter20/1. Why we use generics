GENERICS

Less fragile, more convenient apps by compile time errors 
	instead of possible runtime errors
	
RUNTIME ERRORS vs COMPILE TIME ERRORS
- Compile time errors is checked by Java compiler and prevents you build 
	that may couse errors on fly. Cost is low. You just change the code 
	before distribution of the app
- Runtime errors are programming errors that can be faced after deployment
	application to the users. Cost is high: Bad user experience, loss of users,
	and distribution cost, loss of trust by customers
	
USE OF GENERICS - TYPE SAFETY
- Java is a type-safe language
- Generics force type-safe programming more and more for more stable applications
- Restricts specific type of objects inside collections and methods
- A list that may contain only String items:
	List<String>
- A list that contain only MyClass instances and instances of subclass of MyClass class:
	List<? extends MyClass>
