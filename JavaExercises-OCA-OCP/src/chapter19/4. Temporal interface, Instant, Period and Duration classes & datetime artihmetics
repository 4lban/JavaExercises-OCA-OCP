TEMPORAL INTERFACE

- All date and time representing classes implement this interface
- LocalDateTime, LocalDate, LocalTime, ZonedDateTime, OffsetDateTime, Instant
	Year, YearMonth, HijrahDate, JapanaseDate, MinguoDate, ThaiBuddhistDate class
	implements Temporal
- Arithmetic functions and builder method arguments are Temporal since we need
	type of objects be available on these classes.
	
	
INSTANT and INTERVAL
- Instant: Nanosecond precision of time
  __________________________________________________________
  				^								Time-line 
  				|
  			 Instant
  
- Interval: Interval of time on timeline
  __________________________________________________________
  			^						^			Time-line 
  			|_______________________|
  Start Instant     Interval		End Instant
  
  
DURATION and PERIOD
- Duration is the time model in terms of seconds and nanoseconds
- Used for representing durations not a point on timeline
- End time is optional. Duration is used for calculating the end time mostly.
- If end time is given, it can be used for calculating the time difference between two points on timeline.
- Period is the same thing but used on dates not times.
  __________________________________________________________

CHRONOUNIT
- An enumeration representing standard set of Period units.
- Used for date arithmetic units.
- YEARS, MONTHS, DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS, MILLIS etc...
