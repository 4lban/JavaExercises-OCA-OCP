JAVA 8
DATE AND TIME API

PROBLEMS OF PREVIOUS DATE & TIME
- Objects were mutable
- Full of confusion. Default Date starts from 1900, month starts from 1, and day from 0
- Timezone management was so hard
- Date and time arithmetics were hard
- API was not fluent. Not able to chain the methods

OUR AGENDA
- New date and time classes
- Period, Instant, Duration, Interval operations
- New date / time parsing, formatting methods
- Matcher, Adjuster, Resolver queries
- Time zone operations
- Adapting with the previous API
