Anatomy of the HTTP requests in detail and HTTP session

We going to explore details in browser when we press submit button

Session is located store data special to a client and inside of web browser page
	whenever you call the URL that JESESSIONID=3414324... is always the same
	
Open two tabs in web browser and call same URL from each of the tab
	and we see the JSESSIONID is the same and is stored inside server
	so whenever we make request JSESSIONID will be shared among requests
	
	
Details of session object

OBJECT SCOPES in SERVLETCONTEXT

At the top of the hierarchy application context exist. (Application Scope)
 This context has just one instance per server and the same instance is used
 while our server up and running.

Session scope in a narrower scope than application scope
	Session object is created for per client.
	When a brand new client requests something from the application, the session
	object created identified by JSESSIONID.
	All attributes in corresponding session object is shared across different requests
