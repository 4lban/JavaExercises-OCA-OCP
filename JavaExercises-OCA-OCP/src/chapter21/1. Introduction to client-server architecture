J2EE COMPONENTS
Basic Web Applications

Client - Server Web Applications	(two tier architecture)

 		 
  CLIENT    <---------HTTP Protocol-------->	SERVER			
 HTML page								Process data and respond with result
 
 
 HTTP PROTOCOL standard behaviors
 - GET method
 	Ask server for a resource via a URI
 	(HTML page, image, MP3 etc)
 - POST method
 	Send a web form to server and get a resource
 - HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE
 
Client side - JSP for Java
 Regardless of the technology you use for client side, they are converted to HTML
 
Server side -
may return a basic string by AJAX and XML instead of entire HTML page


  CLIENT    <---------HTTP Protocol-------->	SERVER			
 JSP page								Processing unit (SERVLET)
										Processing unit (SERVLET)
										
An application server or a servlet container dispatches HTTP requests to
	related servletes according to the rules in a deployment descriptor	
	
	
NEED FOR APPLICATION SERVERS					
- Dispatch requests
- Thread management
- Session management
- Caching and object pooling


In short while developing J2EE application we develop JSP and SERVLETS
	and serve them on the application server and write some configuration
	files like .XML to regulate the interactions among files
	We will use Apache Tomcat
