Open Eclipse in Java EE perspective
New Dynamic Web Project
Named --> QA_Pro

'Java Resources' will include your servlets source files
'build' folder will include binary (compiled) version of your servlets
'WebContent' hold all data related to web page, HTML, JSP, XML, JavaScript, CSS etc..
'WEB-INF' holds your secret files that are invisible to web browser 
	If you want your files to be found by the web browser directly just put them
	in WebContent but outside of WEB-INF

	
Install Tomcat Server
	We need to have installed modules to be able to install Tomcat

	It's a basic HMTL page but has some special notation like
	<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%> tells that is written by Java
    Need to change to charset=UTF-8 and pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
    
Let's create a new Servlet
	New, Servlet
	Java package name should be unique in all the world: com.quapro.register
	Class name: RegisterMember
