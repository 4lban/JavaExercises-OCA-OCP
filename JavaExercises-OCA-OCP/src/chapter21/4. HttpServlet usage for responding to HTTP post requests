HttpServlet usage for responding to HTTP post requests

Let's check our web.xml file inside WEB-INF folder
	
	If web.xml isn't there
	 Right click in Deployment Description:, Generate Deployment Descriptor Stub (web.xml)

	web.xml file is a deployment descriptor.
	It describes the structure of the web application to your web server.
	 
	value 'QA_Pro' inside <display-name>QA_Pro</display-name> will be used in our URL
	 http://localhost:8080/QA_Pro/RegisterMember
	Different server may work on different ports. Tomcat works on 8080
	
	We have servlet configuration under <servlet/>
	 It's name is RegisterMember
	 and is requested by URL <url-pattern>/RegisterMember</url-pattern>
	 so when we type http://localhost:8080/QA_Pro/RegisterMember 
	 the RegisterMember will be invoked
	 
	We have two parameters in this URL
	http://localhost:8080/QA_Pro/RegisterMember?name=alban&surname=maxhuni
	 when we click enter this URL these values via GET methods so we need to
	 implement doGet() method inside RegisterMember servlet
	 
	 	String name = request.getParameter("namee");
		String surname = request.getParameter("surnamee");
		System.out.println(name + " " + surname);
		
	
Using HTTP Post Method  
	We created index.jsp inside WebContent folder
	POST method inside form is used to send all values to the RegisterMember servlet
	
	Also we implemented doPost method in RegisterMember servlet
	
		System.out.println("Request is a POST request");
		String name = request.getParameter("name");
		String surname = request.getParameter("surname");
		System.out.println(name + " " + surname);
