Redirecting the Http request to a JSP page and accessing values with scriptlet

We will implement the 2nd way of returning a response
For this we will use RequestDispatcher object of ServletContext

SCRIPTLET in JSP
	A scriptlet is a piece of Java-code embedded in the HTML.
	The scriptlet is everything inside the <% %> tags.
	Between these the user can add any valid Scriplet i.e. any valid Java Code.
	
IMPLICIT OBJECTS in JSP 
	that you can use inside scriptlets
	
	application 		javax.servlet.ServletContext
	out					javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter
	request				javax.servlet.ServletRequest
	response			javax.servlet.ServletResponse
	session				javax.servlet.http.HttpSession
	page				javax.lang.Object
	servletconfig		javax.servlet.ServletConfig
	
We created registercompleted.jsp
and in RegisterMember we configured request to redirect to registercompleted.jsp

	RequestDispatcher defines an object that reveives requests from the client 
	and sends them to any resouce (such as a servlet, HTML file, or JSP file)
	on the server.
	
	getServletContext() is a implicit method of HttpServlet class
	RequestDispatcher rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/registercompleted.jsp");
