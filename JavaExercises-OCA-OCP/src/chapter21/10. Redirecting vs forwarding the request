REDIRECTING REQUEST

Request forwarding and redirection are different concepts.

When you forward a request, request and responds objects are transferred.
	URL stays the same.
	
When you redirect the request to another JSP/servlet, 
	request and response objects are not transferred to new object.
	URL changes to the directory of new page.
	We need an independent page, independent from request parameters.
	
	response.sendRedirect("secondstep.jsp");
