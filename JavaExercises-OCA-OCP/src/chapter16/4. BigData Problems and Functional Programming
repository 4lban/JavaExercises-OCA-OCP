MULTICORE SUPPORT AND THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION IN JAVA
- For/Join for multicore in Java
- Thread and ThreadPool for multi-thread
- Leverage all cores of CPU. Distribute the tasks each core and then combine the results

BIG-DATA AND MAP-REDUCE
- Huge data is processed in chunks, each chunk yields an intermediate form of data
- Intermediate data is combined into single result.
- None of the functions may affect each other but simply yield a single result without a side effect.
- Each operation must be an independent pure function.
- So, functional programming is cut out for these type of problems.
