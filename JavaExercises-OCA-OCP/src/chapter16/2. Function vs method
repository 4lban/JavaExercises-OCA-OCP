FUNCTION... YOU MEAN METHOD???
- No, I don't mean the methods inside a class we defined a million times.
- Repeat after me: FUNCTION IS NOT METHOD!
- Methods are not independent program units and they are bound to another context, 
  like an object instance or class.
- Methods may depend upon values other than its arguments
- Methods may change the values of its arguments or some other static values
- Pure functions are opposite.

WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
- Lives dependently
- Does not depend to any value other than its arguments
- Only output of a function is a value
- Does not change any argument's value or any other external value.
- Functions may return other functions as output.
- Functions may be composed together regardless of the context

WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
- Functions exist independently. Not bound to objects or classes
- Functions can not change the state of any object or value
- All values are immutable. Hates mutability!
- No iteration. Operations are done by recursion.
