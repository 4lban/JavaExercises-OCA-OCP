- Do you remember synchronised keyword, Barriers,
  Semaphores, Locks and their lack of sweetness?
- Have you ever scratched your hair because of deadlocks,
  thread starving, unexpected values of non-atomic object
  operations?
- We created the devil, intentionally, ourselves, We! Phew!
  Why?
