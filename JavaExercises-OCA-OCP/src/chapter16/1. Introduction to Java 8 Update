FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN JAVA 8

Greatest update to Java

- Inspired by JVM languages such as Scala and Clojure and frameworks like Guava
- Rise of functional programming

WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAM
- A programming style that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical
  functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
- Based on lambda calculus. (Some inputs are transformed to some output without
  modifying the input)
- No iteration, no for loop. no variable.

NO ITERATION?
- What? Without a for loop, how I will process all elements of an ArrayList?
- Yes seems weird. You need to change your mindset. Mind bending at first.

Imperative
	List<String> errors = new ArrayList<>();
	int errorCount = 0;
	File file = new File(fileName);
	String line = file.readLine();
	while(errorCount < 40 && line != null) {
		if(line.startsWith("ERROR")) {
			errors.add(line);
			errorCount++;
		}
		line = file.readLine();
	}
	
Functional
	Files.lines(Paths.get(fileName))
		.filter(l -> l.startsWith("ERROR")
		.limit(40)
		.collect(toList());
