Equality testing

- Method equals() tests whether two objects have same contents
- By contrast, == operator test 2 references to see if they point to
  the same object (or test primitive values for equality)
- Need to define for each class what "equality" means:
	- Compare all fields
	- Compare 1 or 2 key fields
	
	- If you don't define what equality means, JVM will compare the address by default.
	

Equality testing

- Object.equals tests for identity:
	public class Object
	{
		public boolean equals(Object obj)
		{	
			return this == obj;
		}
	}
- Override equals if you don't want to inherit that behaviour

Requirements for equals(() method
- Must be reflexive: for any reference x, x.equals(x) is true
- Must be symmetric: for any reference x and y, x.equals(y) is true
  if and only if y.equals(x) is true
- Must be transitive: if x.equals(y) and y.equals(z), then x.equals(z)
- If x is not null, then x.equals(null) must be false
