HASHING

Hashing means summarizing the data so that it can be categorized later on.
(ex. finding an object inside several object instances)

Hash Code Creation
Summarizing the data by custom algorithm


Technique used to find elements in a data structure quickly, without doing full linear search

Important concepts:
-Hash code: integer value used to find array index for data storage/retrieval
-Hash table: array of elements arranged according  to hash code
-Hash function: computes hash code for element; uses algorithm likely to 
  produce different hash codes for different objects to minimize collisions
  
Default hashCode()
-Hashes memory address of object; consistent with default equals() method
-If you override equals(), you should also redefine hashCode()
-For class you are defining, use product of hash of each field and a prime number,
 then add these together - result is hash code
 
 Example
 public class Employe {
 	public int hashCOde() {
 		return 11*name.hashCode() + 13*new Double(salary).hashCode(); 
 	}
 }
 
 hashCodes will be used inside Collections
